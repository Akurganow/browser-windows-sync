## Core Principles

1. **NEVER try to find a bypass, ALWAYS find the root cause and resolve it**
   - Understand the underlying issue before attempting to fix it
   - Don't implement workarounds that mask the real problem
   - Investigate thoroughly to identify the true source of the issue

2. **NEVER take the easiest way, ALWAYS take the right way, there's no rush**
   - Prioritize correctness and maintainability over quick fixes
   - Consider the long-term implications of your changes

3. **ALWAYS respect project architecture and configuration**
   - Follow the established patterns and structures
   - Maintain separation of concerns

4. **ALWAYS strictly adhere to existing project practices, patterns, and conventions**
   - Follow the coding style used in the project
   - Maintain consistency with the rest of the codebase

5. **ALWAYS follow the best development practices and avoid antipatterns**
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
   - Avoid code duplication
   - Write comprehensive tests

6. **ALWAYS be honest about limitations and potential issues in proposed
   solutions**
   - Document known limitations
   - Be transparent about potential edge cases

7. **NEVER hide mistakes or problems â€” be transparent and explain challenges clearly**
   - If you make a mistake, acknowledge it and learn from it
